# Folium Trees Open Data

Repository used in one of my Medium articles containing scripts for visualizing an open data dataset containing over 2 million GPS positions of trees in French urban areas.

The dataset is available on datagouv.fr and has been published by the company namR from other datasets published by French municipalities.

This repository covers : 
- Efficient placement of custom markers
- Heat map with a draggable legend
- Choropleth map of tree density by department
